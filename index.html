  <div class="entry-content"><p>I use Emacs to manage multiple different projects simultaneously. Every
professional engagement I&rsquo;ve had so far has had me working on multiple
codebases at once. Add these to this my elisp and Org Mode files, and that&rsquo;s a
lot of frames to have open!</p>

<p>My first attempt at managing multiple projects had the unintended consequence
of holding me back from fully realizing the full potential of Emacs. I ran
<code>emacsclient</code> sessions in GNU Screen for each project I worked on. I could
flip between different frame configurations, each one set up for an individual
project.  This worked well enough that it kept me from running Emacs as a
graphical interface.</p>

<p>Eventually, <a href="http://jrock.us/">Jon Rockway</a> convinced me that I should abandon
command-line emacs and use Emacs as it was intended; as a graphical
application. However, I had developed a dependence on multiplexing in my
workflow that was hard to break. I first tried
<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsLispScreen">Elscreen</a>, which allowed me
to try multiplexing my projects natively in Emacs. However, the default
configuration took up screen real estate and I didn&rsquo;t have the patience to try
and remove it; so I quickly started to look for alternatives.</p>

<h2>Escreen</h2>

<p>The next option I came across was
<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsScreen">escreen</a>. This was better suited
to my workflow, and it used existing resources to manage workspace
switching. Specifically, it embedded the window configurations into the buffer
used to store frame configuration information, which I thought was
ingenious. I was able to configure it so that my transitions between my
constantly open GNU Screen terminal and Emacs was seamless. I would combine
this with matching up the screen numbers per project, which allowed me to
navigate my project transitions with very little mnemonic overhead.</p>

<p>Escreen is an excellent package, but still left a few features wanting.
Specifically, I wanted:</p>

<ul>
<li>Named Workgroups - While matching up terminal numbers goes a long way, it
would be much better if I could give my window configurations meaningful
names.</li>
<li>Persistence - I set my windows up in the same configuration and order, and
reconfiguring emacs takes a while.  The more I can automate that process,
the better.</li>
<li>Active Development - <code>escreen</code> hasn&rsquo;t seen any development in a few years,
and I do not have the time and/or experience to round off the sharp edges.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Workgroups</h2>

<p>A bit of research led me to check out
<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/WorkgroupsForWindows">workgroups</a>. Puns aside,
this is an excellent piece of software for managing window configurations. I
was able to install the package from MELPA and configure it close enough to my
<code>escreen</code> configuration so that I haven&rsquo;t been able to functionally notice the
difference. Here is what I have so far:</p>

<p>Most of the code here was provided by this Stack Overflow
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11263960/what-is-the-best-emacs-workspaces-plugin">post</a>.</p>

<p>So what do I have now?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I can now switch to workgroups by name! This makes it much easier for me to
name projects and completely forget about matching up numbers. I can still
match up numbers if I want, but why bother?</p></li>
<li><p>I can restore my workgroup list after a restart. This makes it much easier
to reboot and get back to where I left off.</p></li>
<li><p>Re-ordering workgroups is easy and awesome.  Using my configuration, <code>C-z
C-,</code> and <code>C-z C-.</code> will move a workgroup left and right, respectively. This
makes it much easier to arrange things in case something gets out of whack.</p></li>
<li><p>All my key bindings are still the same. I don&rsquo;t have to worry about altering
any of my muscle memory to accommodate for a new workflow; it is just the
same plus more features.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>The Ugly Remains</h2>

<p><code>workgroups</code> is definitely a much more mature and polished product. Despite
this, <code>escreen</code> was able to dodge a lot of rough edges and rely on Emacs&rsquo;s own
built in abstractions by using the frame buffer to host workgroups that I am
missing with <code>workgroups</code> so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>Per-workgroup switch-buffer lists - With <code>escreen</code>, each workgroup had its
own list of visited buffers.  This meant that my buffer visiting activities
bled into each other less frequently.  It appears that with <code>workgroup</code> that
the visited buffer list is not localized to the workgroup, which is
frustrating.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Final Steps</h2>

<p>Despite the progress, There are a few things left on my to-do list for <code>workgroups</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Persistent buffers - I haven&rsquo;t yet managed this. The only thing that gets
saved and restored right now are my buffer names.</p></li>
<li><p>Default new workgroups - I would like to have some default behavior when
creating new windows. I name my windows after my projects; if I open a
workgroup <code>foo</code> and there exists a directory <code>$HOME/git/foo</code>, I would like
for the window to have a magit buffer there open to the project, waiting for
me.  If I could get this to work in conjunction with
<a href="https://github.com/jrockway/eproject">eproject</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile">projectile</a>, that would be icing on
the cake.</p></li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am setting up an OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion) machine as a development
machine. For my own personal use I prefer using a Linux box, but between my
own nostalgia for <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a> and the peculiar yet
undeniable strength of <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">homebrew</a>, I am
perfectly happy to use it as a day-to-day development machine.</p>

<p>In order to use homebrew to its fullest, I edited the

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the most productive &ldquo;A-Ha!&rdquo; moments I&rsquo;ve had as a developer came when I
learned how to use iterators, and the dramatic effect that it has on my coding
style. When we introduced the concept to one layer of code to handle a
specific problem, the pattern of development proved infectious for dealing
with similar workflows and managed to make our code much more succinct and
understandable to newcomers.</p>

<p>At a past place of $WORK, I worked on a project where we wanted to add a
REST-ful API to our data, but we had to deal with blocking SQL queries whose
completion took longer than any sane HTTP timeout should be. The result was
that we needed to stream the formatted output of the query.</p>

<p>It turns out that most REST-type plugins for Catalyst don&rsquo;t handle streaming
output, so we couldn&rsquo;t use something off the shelf.  However, we did discover
a module called
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Iterator::Simple">Iterator::Simple</a>.  This
allowed us to construct on-the-fly formatters that we could then stream to the
users. Now all of our code stopped looking like ugly while loops and temporary
variables, and turned into this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>8</span>

<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='perl'><span class='line'><span class="k">use</span> <span class="nn">Iterator::</span><span class="n">Simple</span> <span class="sx">qw(iflatten imap)</span><span class="p">;</span>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">iflatten</span> <span class="p">[</span>
</span><span class='line'>       <span class="s">&#39;&lt;nodes&gt;&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="n">imap</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">format_node</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$_</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="nv">$nodes_rs</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="s">&#39;&lt;/nodes&gt;&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">];</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The fun didn&rsquo;t stop there.  It started becoming clear that chaining and
passing around iterators was a great way to quickly set up the construction of
data sets, then pass those constructions along to consumers. A small library
of macros had managed to invade our code and make it very, very lazy.</p>

<p>It turned out that many of our data preparation routines were expressible as
computations that didn&rsquo;t need to live in memory. Anywhere we were running a
loop and processing data, we could refactor that region with <code>imap</code> and a code
block, and have the code execute on a per-needed basis.</p>

<p>The only one gripe that I have with this module is that its file handle
emulation is incomplete.  The module emulates the <code>getline</code> syntax; e.g.; the
<code>&amp;&lt;&gt;</code> operator, but not the method. Right now,
<a href="https://metacpan.org/source/MIYAGAWA/Catalyst-Engine-PSGI-0.13/lib/Catalyst/Engine/PSGI.pm">Catalyst::Engine::PSGI</a>
assumes that the <code>getline</code> method is implemented on the resource to be
streamed.  This is true of file handles, but not of
<code>Iterator::Simple::Iterator</code> objects. If the latter provided that interface,
then this module would increase dramatically in utility. I have filed
<a href="https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=72629">a bug</a> and submitted a
patch, so we&rsquo;ll see how it plays out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Within the next 24 hours, my <a href="http://pcmantz.github.com">GitHub Page</a> should
be accessible any- and everywhere from my preferred vanity domain,
<a href="http://mcpantz.org">mcpantz.org</a>. Right now I am having it redirect as a
top-level domain, mostly for shortened URL length.  I would love to hear of
any downsides, other than some sort of fragility in long-term resource names.</p>

<p>Also, I need to find a decent image post, as numerous of my WordPress-era
posts had embedded URLs to images that are now broken.  I&rsquo;m not too keen on
<a href="http://imgur.com/">imgur.com</a>, and the last time I used
<a href="http://imageshack.us/">ImageShack</a> was the early 00&rsquo;s.  Does anyone have some
good, modern suggestion for long-term image hosting, particularly for
hot-linking into websites?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I attended my Fourth <a href="http://yapcna.org/">YAPC::NA</a> this past week, and just
as usual, I had a blast. Conferences are valuable experiences that allow one
to step back and re-evaluate one&rsquo;s work compared to the Zeitgeist of the
community.</p>

<p>There were a lot of excellent talks this year, and even more that I didn&rsquo;t
see.  The one that left everyone&rsquo;s jaw on the floor was
<a href="twitter.com/mcholste">Martin Holste</a>&rsquo;s
<a href="http://blog.yapcna.org/post/23780340461/perl-for-big-data">Perl For Big Data</a>. There
were a lot of talks on &ldquo;big data&rdquo; but The sheer <em>audacity</em> that this project
displayed was impressive.  Holste demonstrated lightning fast search,
management-pleasing data analysis, and massive distributed throughput on some
absurd amount of real-time data. The amazing part of it all was that his team
accomplished this not by scaling up their hardware, but by using standard open
source software to its limits.</p>

<p>Another general trend that I&rsquo;m quite happy to see is that Perl hackers are
thieving magpies. Stevan Little of <a href="http://moose.perl.org/">Moose</a> fame
demonstrated <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Web::Machine">Web::Machine</a> as a
clone of Basho&rsquo;s <a href="http://wiki.basho.com/Webmachine.html">Webmachine</a>. I am
merely looking for an excuse to use it
now. <a href="http://www.genehack.org/">Genehack</a> also unveiled
<a href="https://github.com/genehack/HiD">HiD</a>, a Jekyll clone. I was surprised that
Miyagawa, one of the first Perl hackers to be notorious for rifling the pocket
change of other language&rsquo;s libraries, did not show off any new libraries, but
did a great talk on comparing his experiences with the Python and Ruby
ecosystems he has plumbed in the past, and how to bring the good parts back to
Perl.</p>

<p>Beyond the technical, it was fun to connect and reconnect with a lot of people
I&rsquo;ve interacted with on IRC, twitter, and in past lives at past jobs. I am
definitely looking forward to going back again in the future, and I hope to
entice more folk to YAPC, both those new to Perl and those who toil in the
shadows (you know who you are!)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I get a lot of benefit from managing my own Perl via perlbrew, but I&rsquo;m fine
using Ubuntu&rsquo;s packaged Postgres sever. However, Ubuntu strips down a lot of
its applications into components, and you have to install development versions
and header files separately if you want to compile everything. I&rsquo;m putting
this here for anyone who might be trying to install DBD::Pg on top of
perlbrew.  I&rsquo;m not going to claim this will work in all circumstances, and it
assumes you have already installed Postgres, but it definitely worked for me.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install libpq5 postgresql-server-dev-9.1

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the ruby world, many people are aware of the
<a href="http://beginrescueend.com/">ruby rvm</a> tool for ruby version management. Perl
is not generally thought of as a virtual machine with an isolable environment,
because of its frequent deep intertwining with the host operating system.
However, there are tools that make this possible.</p>

<p>The problem with using Perl in this fashion is not that the solution does not
occur to people, but that the solution occurs to <em>many</em> people simultaneously.
Most of the hacker luminaries in the Perl world have invented a respective
solution. <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~bdfoy/">brian d foy</a> has written of his own
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/398221/how-do-you-manage-perl-modules-when-using-a-package-manager/398397#398397">solution</a>,
there is a <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/perlrocks">rubygems</a> implementation in
the wild, and the packaging problem has had multiple attempts made on it.
Today, I&rsquo;d like to review the best-in-class applications, and how to use them.</p>

<h2>local::lib</h2>

<p><a href="https://metacpan.org/module/local::lib">local::lib</a> creates the the
configuration configuration information for a perl package directory without
affecting the system perl&rsquo;s library paths. Before worrying about your base
perl installation, you should know <code>local::lib</code>.  If you have a trustworthy
sysadmin or are a junior dev on a team, this is most likely your situation.</p>

<p><code>local::lib</code> lets you try install modules locally before installing them in a
shared environment to experiment with new features, or install bleeding-edge
versions of Perl-based command line apps like
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/App::GitGot">App::GitGot</a>,
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/App::Ack">App::Ack</a> for personal use.</p>

<h2>perlbrew</h2>

<p>Are you developing in an environment where you have to test against multipleo
perl binaries? Then you should probably give <a href="http://perlbrew.pl/">perlbrew</a> a
try.</p>

<p>This application in a fully-featured suite for bootstrapping a perl
environment. The perlbrew script allows you to install multiple versions of
Perl and maintain library directories much more conveniently. In this regards,
it is much more like rvm.</p>

<p>Another similar feature that perlbrew shares with rvm is its management of
library assets. The perlbrew binary includes a command to install cpanminus,
which hopefully you are using now already (If you are not, I will have to
write another blog post!) This copy coordinates with the built-in lib
functionality to install libaries to the current chosen perl, minimizing the
fuss and clash and conflict.</p>

<h2>Combinations Thereof</h2>

<p>If you are a solo developer who does not need to coordinate the usage of your
development machine with other users, than <em>use perlbrew</em>. It provides the
solutions of all the applications directly in a reproducible, scriptable
manner.</p>

<p>If you are in a situation where setting up your own perl is a troublesome
wreck, use <code>local::lib</code>. You will have a clean library path to experiment
with, and you can feel no guild whatsoever when you muck up a dependency and
need to blow it away.</p>

<p>Regardless of anything, use the right tool for the right job, and make sure
you know that you are getting what you need. If you aren&rsquo;t, complain on
<a href="http://www.irc.perl.org/">IRC</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have started work on a new project where a lot of the source files are huge;
files are commonly over 1,000 lines in length.  While this is a massive
<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/05/code-smells.html">code smell</a> that
needs to be dealt with, it doesn&rsquo;t preclude the necessity of working with the
file in the first place.</p>

<p>It appears that emacs has no problem navigating the files, but editing large
files is a royal pain in the rear end.  It appears that the only reasonable
solution to shut off <code>'font-lock-mode</code>.</p>

<p>In addition, I have been using
<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CPerlModeOutlineMode">outline-minor-mode</a> to
narrow the focus of my attention.  Having a top-down view of the file which I
am working with really helps.</p>

<p>I wonder how much hacking would be involved to make comments associated with
their own header; or in the case of indented comments, with the level above
them; as sort of a &ldquo;floating&rdquo; header level rather than a specific one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been an Ubuntu &amp; Mint user for the past few years.  I am not particularly
focused on usability or community, but it is nice using an operating system
where most of the kinks have been ironed out for me by the efforts of others.</p>

<p>Lately, I decided to abandon
<a href="http://www.tenshu.net/p/terminator.html">Terminator</a> in favor of
<a href="http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html">rxvt-unicode</a>,
a.k.a. <code>urxvt</code>.  Already I&rsquo;ve found it to be a lot snappier, but installation
was not simple.  There are a few hoops to jump through yet.</p>

<h2>Install ncurses-term</h2>

<p>Apparently the ubuntu packagers haven&rsquo;t gotten around to bundling the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminfo">terminfo</a> entry for rxvt-unicode into
the package itself, as they probably don&rsquo;t think you need programs like
<code>screen</code> or <code>tmux</code>.  Rather, Ubuntu wants to to install yet another package,
which has no related dependencies. be sure to install the ncurses-term
package, which seems like a good idea anyways.  And if you&rsquo;d like to tell the
Ubuntu packagers that they should fix this, you can go check out this
<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/rxvt-unicode/+bug/772924">bug report</a>.</p>

<h2>Installing rxvt-unicode</h2>

<p>This part is relatively easy, just install the <code>rxvt-unicode</code> package and its
dependencies.</p>

<h2>Setting up the environment</h2>

<p>Configuring <code>rxvt-unicode</code> is done through the <code>~/.Xdefaults</code> configuration
file, which is the historic location of all X11 application data. Since it is
a grab-bag of a file, it is a little harder to find examples.  However, I have
munged through a few and posted my end product in
<a href="https://gist.github.com/1721879">this gist</a>.</p>

<p>If you take nothing else from this configuration, <em>please</em> change the default
colors.  Your eyes will thank me for it, since the blue will be legible.</p>

<h2>Where From Here</h2>

<p>By no means is this journey over.  It turns out that my console is only
supporting 88 colors, and that there are
<a href="http://blog.oldworld.fr/index.php?post/2010/03/21/256-colors-terminal-with-tmux-and-urxvt">others</a>
who have had the same problem.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if any of you are familiar with <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/Dave/">Dr. Fun</a>, but it&rsquo;s a webcomic that I&rsquo;ve been reading since i figured out what webcomics were.  At some point in my college career I realized that the author was lurking around the basement of the Regenstein, the library at the University of Chicago, but I never went to go ferret him out.</p>

<p>It turns out that he&rsquo;s directly my friend&rsquo;s <a href="http://dwarmstr.blogspot.com/">Dean</a>&rsquo;s boss, who this week gave me some old hardware they were not using.  I met Mr. Farley, who was a quiet, enthusiastic geek; pretty much exactly like I envisioned him.  he then showed me an original VT100.</p>
